Used Copilot to create this Readme. Cuz why not ! :)

# Stock Market Prediction Application

This application is designed to predict stock market prices using machine learning models. It is structured in a modular way, with different components responsible for data extraction, model creation, and model testing.

## Main Components

### Data Extraction

The data extraction process is likely handled by the `data_extraction.py` file. Although the exact details are not provided, it's reasonable to assume that this script is responsible for fetching stock market data from an external source.

### Model Creation

The application uses machine learning models to predict stock prices. The details of the model creation process are not provided in the excerpts, but it's likely that this process involves training a model on historical stock market data.

### Model Testing

The [`PmTesting`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%2FLearningapp%2FmodelTesting.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py") class in [``app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%2FLearningapp%2FmodelTesting.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/voldemort/work/lstm_stock_prediction/app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py") is responsible for testing the accuracy of the machine learning models. It provides methods for calculating model accuracy and for plotting the real stock price against the predicted stock price.

The [`TickerTesting`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%2FLearningapp%2FmodelTesting.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A71%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py") class in the same file tests the models for multiple tickers. It reads the data for each ticker, loads the corresponding model, and calculates the model's accuracy. If the [`graph`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%2FLearningapp%2FmodelTesting.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A76%2C%22character%22%3A123%7D%5D "app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py") attribute is set to `True`, it also saves a graph of the real stock price vs the predicted stock price.

## Running the Application

The main entry point of the application is likely the [``main.py``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/voldemort/work/lstm_stock_prediction/main.py") file. The exact details of how to run the application are not provided in the excerpts, but it's likely that running [``main.py``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/voldemort/work/lstm_stock_prediction/main.py") will execute the data extraction, model creation, and model testing processes.

## Additional Files

- `app.py` and `config.py` likely contain the main application logic and configuration settings, respectively.
- `requirements.txt` lists the Python packages that the application depends on.
- `rec.json` and `OUTPUT_COM.txt` might be used for logging or storing intermediate results.
- [`test_model.h5`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%2FLearningapp%2FmodelTesting.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "app/Learningapp/modelTesting.py") is likely a pre-trained machine learning model that can be used for testing purposes.

The [``app``](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fvoldemort%2Fwork%2Flstm_stock_prediction%2Fapp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/voldemort/work/lstm_stock_prediction/app") directory contains a `database` subdirectory, which might be used for storing processed data.

## Conclusion

This application is a comprehensive tool for predicting stock market prices. It uses machine learning models trained on historical data to make predictions, and provides tools for testing the accuracy of these models.
